# Rutsjebane
Rutsjebane is a simple javascript web app for showing presentations with slides.
It will support multiple presentations and a simple UI for selecting which presentation 
to show and have limited capabilities for sorting into categories.

This is currently a very early versions.

All of the presentations are currently hardcoded into the code. The code is not meant to
be elegant, only to work well enough. There are many known bugs so beware if you want to
use it!

Rutsjebane is the norwegian word for slide.
